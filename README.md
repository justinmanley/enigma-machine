The Enigma Code is the code that the Germans used for military communication during World War II.
The strength of the Enigma code comes from the sheer number of ciphers that can be generated combined
with its ease of use.  The Enigma machine is the mechanical/electrical device used to encode messages
in the Enigma code (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine).  

This is an implementation of the Enigma machine in python.
